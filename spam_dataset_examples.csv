According to the CDC, measles was offically eliminated in 2000, which means &#34;there is no measles spreading within the country and new cases are only found when someone contracts measles abroad and returns to the country.&#34;  So we have measles cases still, every year and 48 cases is not very big when looking back to 2000.

"So Trump and Lindsey gonna threaten to turn the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers loose on us if Trump has to face his day in court like anyone else would ?? ,,..

And spare us the apples and oranges &#34;Hillary&#34; comparison... Trump and his minions were in charge of the Attorney Generals Office, DOJ, and the FBI for 4 years...There were 2 investigations of her emails..  If there was any charge out there they though they could have made stick they would have done so....    Hell,, he compaigned on &#34;lock her up&#34;,,,  Just like 8 GOP Benghazi investigations,,, all accusations,, never any evidence to charge her let alone get a conviction....

Trump can have his day in court,,  put forth his side,, cross examine witnesses,, confront evidence,, and let a real jury decided,,,  THAT&#39;S HOW WE DO IT UNDER RULE OF LAW, LINDSEY !!",0

"<p>It cost $178k per hour to fly AF One from preflight to post flight.

"<p>Farmers cannot afford to pay bribes to people endorsing and approving their loan applications, that is why farmers are unable to borrow.</p><p>At UCPB, bank loans were approved without bribes, but the officers demand 3-5% of loan proceeds when the loan was about to be released. Dominguez found this out later in the Duterte administration.</p><p>Land Bank lends to large scale projects like roads where borrower plants asphalt overlay instead of rice, to steel plants that are doomed to fail due to competition from Chinese steelmakers with economies of scale, to mining companies that dig land leaving dirt and competing for scarce financing that foreign investors should have brought into the country, to domestic conglomerates getting behest loans due to pressure from high-ranked politicians, etc. Land Bank is the vault keepr of powerful politicians and large borrowers willing to pay big bribes.</p><p>Agri borrowers have risky credit rating, but Land Bank can compensate for the risk by (1) charging premium on interest rates, and (2) buying finished agricultural products like rice, corn coconuts with low risk of spoilage. Absent Land Bank, the traders finance the farmers charging extremely high financing cost normally exceeding 30% per annum. For example, the trader buys copra at P40/kg and sells it for P60/kg to oil mills, to make at least P10/kg after operating costs. For 3 cycles in one year, the trader charges the coconut farmer 10/40*3 = 75% financing cost.</p>",0
